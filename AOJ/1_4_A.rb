# A/B Problem
# Write a program which reads two integers a and b, and calculates the following values:

# a รท b: d (in integer)
# remainder of a รท b: r (in integer)
# a รท b: f (in real number)
# Input
# Two integers a and b are given in a line.

# Output
# Print d, r and f separated by a space in a line. For f, the output should not contain an absolute error greater than 10-5.

a,b = gets.split(' ').map(&:to_i)

d = a /b
r = a % b
f = a.to_f / b

printf "%d %d %.10f", d, r, f #"#{d} #{r} #{f.to_s(}"
