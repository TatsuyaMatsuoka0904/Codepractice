# Card Game

# Taro and Hanako are playing card games. They have n cards each, and they compete n turns. At each turn Taro and Hanako respectively puts out a card. The name of the animal consisting of alphabetical letters is written on each card, and the bigger one in lexicographical order becomes the winner of that turn. The winner obtains 3 points. In the case of a draw, they obtain 1 point each.

# Write a program which reads a sequence of cards Taro and Hanako have and reports the final scores of the game.

# Input
# In the first line, the number of cards n is given. In the following n lines, the cards for n turns are given respectively. For each line, the first string represents the Taro's card and the second one represents Hanako's card.

# Constraints
# n â‰¤ 1000
# The length of the string â‰¤ 100
s = [0,0]
c = gets.chomp.to_i


c.times do
    a,b = gets.chomp.split(" ")
    if a > b
        s[0]+=3
    elsif b > a
        s[1]+=3
    else
        s[0]+=1
        s[1]+=1
    end
end
